We implemented a variety of surface-form, semantic, and sentiment features. with sentiment-word hashtags, and one from tweets with emoticons. In the message-level task, the lexicon-based features provided a gain of 5 F-score points over all others. Both of our systems can be replicated us available resources.},

	shorttitle = {A new {ANEW}},
	abstract = {Sentiment analysis of microblogs such as Twitter has recently gained a fair amount of attention. One of the simplest sentiment analysis approaches compares the words of a posting against a labeled word list, where each word has been scored for valence, -- a 'sentiment lexicon' or 'affective word lists'. There exist several affective word lists, e.g., {ANEW} (Affective Norms for English Words) developed before the advent of microblogging and sentiment analysis. I wanted to examine how well {ANEW} and other word lists performs for the detection of sentiment strength in microblog posts in comparison with a new word list specifically constructed for microblogs. I used manually labeled postings from Twitter scored for sentiment. Using a simple word matching I show that the new word list may perform better than {ANEW}, though not as good as the more elaborate approach found in {SentiStrength}.},

In our study, we focus on analyzing the most retweeted 50 tweets for everyday during September and October 2016. The resulting set is composed 3,050 viral tweets, and they were retweeted over 20.5 million times. We manually annotated the tweets as favorable of Trump, Clinton, or neither. Our quantitative study shows that tweets favoring Trump were usually retweeted more than pro-Clinton tweets, with the exception of a few days in September and two days in October, especially the day following the first presidential debate and following the release of the Access Hollywood tape. On two days in October 2016, pro-Trump tweet volume accounted for than 90{\textbackslash}\% of the total tweet volume.},

# Abstract 

Donald Trump, the current president of the United States, has always been very active on social media. His
explicit words have been on the top of the news many times. His post on Twitter (known as tweets) are the
subject of this project. The goal of this project is to study any association between his tweets and the oil
price in the world market.
Sentiment analysis is the approach which is used in this project. First, a dataset of his tweets is collected.
Then, by using sentiment analysis approaches points are assigned to his tweets per day. Finally, these points
have been compared with the variation of oil price in world market. Three well known lexicons, nrc (defined
by Saif Mohammad and Peter Turney), AFINN (defined by Finn Ã…rup Nielsen), and Bing (defined by Bing
Liu and collaborators) are used in this study.
